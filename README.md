# Veil-Xfer

**Encrypted file sharing over Tor hidden services.**

Veil-Xfer is a privacy-focused file transfer application that enables anonymous, end-to-end encrypted file sharing through the Tor network. Built with a GTK3 graphical interface, it provides multiple transfer modes — server hosting, direct send, peer-to-peer — all routed through Tor onion services for maximum anonymity.

> **Note**: This is **not** the official [Veil-Xfer](https://Veil-Xfer.org) project by Freedom of the Press Foundation. This is an independent, unaffiliated project that happens to share the same name.

## Features

### Military-Grade Encryption
- **AES-256-GCM** chunk-level encryption
- **RSA-4096** key wrapping
- **HKDF-SHA256** key derivation
- **PBKDF2** (1M iterations) password protection

### Tor Integration
- Automatic Tor hidden service creation
- Multi-circuit rotation for traffic analysis resistance
- Per-sub-server independent onion addresses
- Configurable Tor SOCKS proxy support

### Multiple Transfer Modes
| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Share** | Host files on an onion server for others to download |
| **Receive** | Download files from a remote Veil-Xfer server |
| **Send** | Push a file directly to a remote server |
| **P2P** | Peer-to-peer transfer with no central server |
| **Server** | Full server mode with distributed chunk storage |

### Distributed & Parallel
- Up to **128 independent sub-servers** for parallel chunk transfer
- Round-robin chunk distribution across sub-servers
- Each sub-server runs its own Tor hidden service
- Configurable chunks-per-sub-server (2 or 4)

### Secure Vault
- Local encrypted file vault
- Password-protected storage with PBKDF2 key derivation
- Import/export encrypted files

### Zero Trust Architecture
- Rate-limited access (lockout after 5 failed attempts)
- Stack protector, PIE, RELRO, non-executable stack
- Hardened build flags by default

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **OS**: Linux (Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch)
- **Tor**: Must be installed and available in `$PATH`
- **GCC**: C compiler with C11 support

### Install Dependencies

```bash
# Automatic (detects apt, dnf, or pacman)
./install_deps.sh

# Or manually on Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libgtk-3-dev \
    libmicrohttpd-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev tor
```

### Build & Run

```bash
# Build
make -j$(nproc)

# Build and run
make run

# Or use the build script
./build.sh run
```

### Release Binary

```bash
make release
# Output: Veil-Xfer.bin (stripped, hardened)
```

## Build Targets

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make` | Build the application |
| `make run` | Build and launch |
| `make release` | Stripped + hardened binary |
| `make check` | Verify all dependencies |
| `make install-deps` | Install dependencies (apt) |
| `make clean` | Remove build artifacts |
| `make distclean` | Remove build + data directories |
| `make purge` | Remove everything |

## Security Hardening

The build system enables the following protections by default:

- **Stack Protector** (`-fstack-protector-strong`)
- **Position Independent Executable** (`-fPIE` / `-pie`)
- **FORTIFY_SOURCE** level 2
- **Full RELRO** (`-Wl,-z,relro,-z,now`)
- **Non-executable stack** (`-Wl,-z,noexecstack`)
- **Stack clash protection** (`-fstack-clash-protection`)
- **Control flow protection** (`-fcf-protection`)

Verify with:
```bash
make release
# Prints security check results
```

---

## Configuration

### Advanced Settings

The Advanced page in the GUI allows tuning:

- **Chunks per sub-server**: 2 or 4
- **Retry timeout**: Connection retry delay (ms)
- **Max retries**: Number of retry attempts
- **Thread count**: Parallel transfer threads
- **Warmup stagger**: Delay between sub-server launches (ms)

Settings persist across sessions in the configuration file.

### Network Defaults

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| Main server port | `8443` |
| Sub-server port range | `10000–10127` |
| Max sub-servers | `128` |
| P2P default port | `9900` |
| Onion virtual port | `80` |
| Onion bootstrap timeout | `120s` |
